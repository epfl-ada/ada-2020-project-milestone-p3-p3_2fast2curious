## Notes

- `114542-V1.zip` is the zip file you will get if you download from the above link. You will find all the data after unzipping it. There is a nice README file in it too. Be sure to read that so you can get a better understanding of the description of variables in the data.
- You only need `PisoFirme_AEJPol-20070024_household.dta` to reproduce Table 4.
- Do use the pacakge, statsmodels. It's quite easy to compute the clustered standard error using it.

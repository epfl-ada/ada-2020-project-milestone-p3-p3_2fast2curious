# Abstract

The original publication, mentionned above, from which this study is derived, focused on the impact of a large-scale Mexican program that replaces dirt floors with cement floors on the health of children and happiness of adults. Here we proposed to continue the work begun by the authors by using machine learning algorithms to get models with higher reliability, robustness and accuracy. It would especially be centered on finding the main causes of diseases with techniques such as lasso regularization and feature selection algorithm. Then we will investigate about the influence of the program Piso Firme on these features using statistical tools.

## Research questions

 1. What are the main causes of disease ? 
 2. In which ways Piso Firme can explain these diseases ? 

## Proposed dataset

The [original dataset](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/114542/version/V1/view) from the article.

## Methods

 1. Imputation of the missing values with a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. 
 2. Lasso regularization
 3. PCA
 4. Pair-matching
 5. Recursive feature selection

## Proposed timeline

**Week 1** : handling missing values, lasso regularization and PCA to identify relevant features. 
**Week 2** : pair matching to visualize the effect of Piso Firme on the selected features. 
**Week 3** : generation of plots for the report and data story. Start with the report/data story. 
**Week 4** : preparation of the video. 

## Organization within the team

**Elia** : dealing with missing values. Lasso regularization. 
**Hugo** : PCA, feature selection. 
**Pierre** : matching and checking the influence of the Piso Firme. 
**Together** : defining which plots should be made, report/data story and video.

### Abstract

The original publication, mentionned above, from which this study is derived, focused on the impact of a large-scale Mexican program that replaces dirt floors with cement floors on the health of children and happiness of adults. Here we proposed to continue the work begun by the authors by using machine learning algorithms to get models with higher reliability, robustness and accuracy.
